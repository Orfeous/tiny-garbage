== Tiny-Garbage

Just a little FTP crawler, with a little Sinatra based search interface in order to browse the FTP index.
Nothing else, nothing more.

== Dependencies

Required gems are :
- dm-core
- dm-migrations
- dm-is-tree
- dm-aggregates
- dm-sqlite-adapter (or whatever else db, just one line of code to change)
- sinatra
- haml
- sass
- net-ftp-list
- Rack (optionnal)

If you have Bundler installed on your system, you can track down all those dependencies by launching the following command from inside the project directory :
$ bundle install

== Thanks

Thanks to Loic Gomez for the first Garbage Collector, which was so useful through the years, and thanks to Zouchaoqun's ezFtpSearch (http://github.com/zouchaoqun/ezftpsearch) whose model bootstrapped our work.
